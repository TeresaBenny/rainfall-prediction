# rainfall-prediction
This project focuses on predicting rainfall using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical weather data—including temperature, humidity, pressure, and other atmospheric conditions—the model aims to forecast the likelihood and amount of rainfall using Python and Flask framework.
This project aims to develop a predictive model for rainfall, enabling better preparedness for weather-related events.
